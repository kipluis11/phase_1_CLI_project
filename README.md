# phase_1_CLI_project

 This first CLI project is a spell repository for a Wizard class character in D&D 5th edition.  This will allow you to access the spell description for different spells a Wizard can learn.  The spells will appear in alphabetical order, and upon selection will prompt the effect of the spell that you have selected.
