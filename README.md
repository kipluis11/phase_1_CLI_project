# phase_1_CLI_project

 This first CLI project is a spell repository for a Wizard class character in D&D 5th edition.  This will allow you to access the spell description for different spells a Wizard can learn.  when initiated, the spells will appear in alphabetical order and upon selection will prompt the effect of the spell that you have selected.

## Getting Started
To properly run this program you will first have to install the required gems.  To do this, you will have to run 'bundler' in your terminal before you start. 

Once you have installed the gems, start the program by entering, ruby bin/start, in your terminal. This will initiate the Spell Guide.

## Using the Spell 
The Spell guide will welcome you and then ask if you'd like to practice a spell.  If your answer is "yes" the Spell Guide will be summoned.  Any other response will annoy the Headmaster and he will respond with "BE GONE WITH YOU THEN!"

When the Spell guide is summoned, it will list the spells by page number and name.  Entering the page number will then prompt the description and effect of the spell requested to display on your screen.  The Headmaster will then ask you if you'd like to practice magic again.  If you do not answer with a "yes", then he will get angry and respond with "BE GONE WITH YOU THEN!"

## License
